## 2026-01-26: Initialize Go module and package skeleton

Completed the first task: Initialize Go module and package skeleton for toolmodel.

Changes made:
- Created go.mod with module github.com/jraymond/toolmodel
- Created doc.go with comprehensive package documentation describing:
  - The package's purpose as the canonical tool data model based on MCP Tool spec
  - Key features (Tool types, backend bindings, JSON Schema validation)
  - MCP schema rules enforcement
  - No-network guarantee

Gate verification:
- `go build ./...` passes
- `go test ./...` passes (no test files yet)
